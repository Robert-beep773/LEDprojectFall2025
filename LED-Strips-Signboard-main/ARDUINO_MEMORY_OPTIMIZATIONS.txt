# Arduino Memory Optimizations for LED Signboard

## Overview
This document outlines the memory optimizations implemented to prevent crashes on memory-constrained Arduino microcontrollers.

## Problem Addressed
The original code was prone to crashes when receiving large amounts of data or processing complex operations due to:
- Large buffer allocations
- Heap memory usage
- Insufficient bounds checking
- Rapid data transmission

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Buffer Size Reductions
**File**: `MainBoard.ino`
- **Buffer Size**: Reduced from 150 to 100 characters
- **Max Data Length**: Reduced from 100 to 50 characters
- **Reason**: Prevents buffer overflow on memory-constrained Arduino

### 2. Text Length Limits
**File**: `MainBoard.ino` - `processCommand()` function
- **Small Font Text**: Limited to 30 characters maximum
- **Large Font Text**: Limited to 10 characters maximum
- **Reason**: Prevents memory allocation failures during text processing

### 3. Memory Allocation Strategy
**File**: `Display.cpp` - `scrollTextContinuous()` function
- **Before**: Dynamic heap allocation with `new char[]`
- **After**: Stack allocation with fixed-size arrays
- **Buffer Size**: Reduced from 200 to 50 characters per text string
- **Reason**: Stack allocation is more reliable and doesn't fragment memory

### 4. Input Validation Improvements
**File**: `Display.cpp` - `displayCustomPixels()` function
- **Input Length**: Reduced from 1000 to 200 characters
- **Reason**: Prevents processing of excessively large custom pixel data

### 5. Communication Timing
**File**: `custom.js`
- **Pixel Delay**: Increased from 100ms to 200ms between pixels
- **Chunk Delay**: Increased from 500ms to 800ms between chunks
- **Reason**: Gives Arduino more time to process each command

### 6. Minimal Logging
**File**: `MainBoard.ino` - `parseInput()` function
- **Before**: Detailed logging with full command strings
- **After**: Simple "RX" message
- **Reason**: Reduces memory usage and processing overhead

## Memory Usage Comparison

### Before Optimizations:
- Buffer: 150 characters
- Text processing: Up to 200 characters per string
- Custom pixels: Up to 1000 character input
- Memory allocation: Dynamic heap allocation
- Communication: Rapid-fire pixel updates

### After Optimizations:
- Buffer: 100 characters
- Text processing: 30-50 characters maximum
- Custom pixels: 200 character input limit
- Memory allocation: Stack allocation
- Communication: Delayed pixel updates with 200ms+ delays

## Benefits

1. **Stability**: Eliminates memory allocation failures
2. **Reliability**: Prevents buffer overflow crashes
3. **Performance**: Faster processing with smaller data sets
4. **Compatibility**: Works better with memory-constrained Arduino boards

## Usage Guidelines

### For Text Display:
- Keep small font messages under 30 characters
- Keep large font messages under 10 characters
- Use shorter messages for better performance

### For Custom Pixels:
- Limit custom pixel drawings to reasonable sizes
- Allow time between pixel updates (200ms+ delays)
- Clear display before sending new pixel data

### For General Use:
- Avoid rapid-fire commands
- Allow processing time between operations
- Monitor Arduino serial output for error messages

## Error Handling

The optimized code includes improved error handling:
- Input length validation
- Memory allocation checks
- Graceful failure with error messages
- Automatic cleanup of resources

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various text lengths to ensure limits work
2. Test custom pixel drawing with different sizes
3. Monitor Arduino serial output during operation
4. Test rapid command sequences to verify stability
5. Test with power cycling to ensure reliable startup

## Conclusion

These optimizations significantly improve the stability and reliability of the LED signboard system on memory-constrained Arduino microcontrollers while maintaining full functionality.
